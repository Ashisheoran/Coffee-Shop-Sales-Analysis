# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis ☕📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes point-of-sale (POS) transaction data from a coffee shop chain.  
The objective is to understand sales patterns, identify high-performing products and stores, and provide actionable business insights to improve revenue and operations.

---

## Business Problem
Coffee shop businesses need to understand:
- Which products generate the most revenue
- What time periods are busiest
- Which store locations perform best

This analysis helps management make data-driven decisions related to staffing, pricing, and product strategy.

---

## Dataset Information
- Type: Transaction-level sales data
- Each row represents a product sold in a transaction
- Includes date, time, store location, product details, quantity, and price

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature engineering (time-based features, total sales)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Revenue analysis by product, time, and location
- Business insight generation

---

## Key Insights
- Coffee is the primary revenue-driving product category
- Morning hours show peak sales activity
- Store performance varies significantly by location
- Some products sell frequently but generate lower revenue

---

## Business Recommendations
- Increase staff during peak morning hours
- Promote high-margin products during low-traffic periods
- Apply best-selling product strategies to low-performing stores

---

## Limitations
- No cost data, so profit analysis is not possible
- No customer-level data for customer segmentation

---

## Future Improvements
- Add cost and profit analysis
- Perform demand forecasting
- Build interactive dashboards

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow and shows how raw transactional data can be converted into meaningful business insights.
